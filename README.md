## How to Use  
1. Clone and access the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phaa/ibm-python-for-ai.git
   cd ibm-python-for-ai/
   ```
2. Setup virtual environment (conda ou venv):  
   ```bash
   conda create -n env python=3.8
   conda activate env
   ```
3. Start Jupyter lab:  
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
*In each notebook there is a cell dedicated to dependencies instalation*
